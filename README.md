# Hugo's Movie Database

Web application that displays a lists of movies and the details page of the movies.

It is written in JavaScript and [React.js](https://reactjs.org/),
using [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) for state management.

It is powered by [The Movie Database API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3).

## Requirements

A recent version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.

I used v18, but 14+ should suffice.

## Development

This app was created with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), using the JavaScript + SWC preset.

To install the dependencies, run the following command from your console:

(I really recommend using [pNPM](https://pnpm.io/), it's much faster than any other alternative.)

```bash
$ pnpm i
```

Then, to start the development server:

```bash
$ pnpm run dev
```

Of course you can also use plain old npm (or yarn):

```bash
$ npm i
```

```bash
$ npm run dev
```
